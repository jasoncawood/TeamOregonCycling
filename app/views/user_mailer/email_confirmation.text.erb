Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,

Someone (hopefully you!) has used the email address "<%= @user.email %>" to
register an account on the Team Oregon website, and we need you to confirm that
this email address should be associated with that account before the account can
be activated.

Please visit
<%= email_confirmation_url(confirmation_token: @user.confirmation_token) %>
and enter the confirmation code below (if it doesn't appear automatically) to
confirm your email address:

  <%= @user.confirmation_token %>

If this email address should *not* be associated with an account on Team
Oregon's website, you do not need to take any action. The account will not be
active without explicit confirmation and will be removed in one week.

Please contact us at info@teamoregon.org if you have any questions.

Regards,

Team Oregon
